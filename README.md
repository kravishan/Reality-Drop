## Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have Unity 3D and a VR headset installed on your computer. Here are the steps to get started:

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Open the project in Unity.
- Navigate to the Assets/Scenes folder and open the Main scene.
- Connect your VR headset to your computer and make sure it's properly set up.
- Click the play button in the Unity editor to start the game.

## Gameplay
In this game, you'll be standing on a virtual road with cars and bikes coming towards you. Your goal is to estimate the speed of each vehicle as accurately as possible using sound and visual cues.

Each vehicle will pass you by and disappear behind you. You'll then be prompted to enter your estimate of the vehicle's speed in miles per hour (mph). Your estimate will be compared to the actual speed of the vehicle, and you'll receive a score based on how close your estimate was.

The game includes multiple levels with increasing difficulty, and your final score will be calculated based on your performance across all levels.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to create a VR environment in Unity and enable basic interaction and movement using C# scripting. The project can be used as a starting point for more complex VR projects or as a learning tool for those new to Unity and VR development.
